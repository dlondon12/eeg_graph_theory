List of scripts and functions:

1. 'PDC_DTF_matrix.m': A function which computes the time-varying PDC and DTF measures from a multichannel signal.

2. 'SimulatedModel_Connectivity_AAR.m': A script which computes the time-varying PDC and DTF plots for the simulated model
using Adaptive AutoRegressive (AAR) modelling.

3. 'SimulatedModel_Connectivity_ShortTime.m': A script which computes the time-varying PDC and DTF plots for the simulated model
using short-time (windowing) approach.

4. 'EEGData_Connectivity_ShortTime.m': A script which computes the time-varying PDC and DTF plots for the newborn EEG sample
using short-time (windowing) approach.

5. 'mvar.m', 'mvaar.m' and 'covm.m': Slightly altered versions of the BioSig toolbox functions (please see http://biosig.sourceforge.net/
for more details and copyright license).

6. 'arfit.m', 'arord.m' and 'arqr.m': Slightly altered versions of the ARFIT toolbox functions (please see http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~tapio/arfit/
for more details and copyright license).
